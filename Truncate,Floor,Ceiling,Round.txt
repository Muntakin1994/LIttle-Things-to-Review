Truncate: this conversion simply removes any fractional part from the number. A number like 1.65 truncates to 1.0; -1.65 truncates to -1.0.
This is the default if keyword is omitted.

Floor: this conversion chooses the largest (closest to positive infinity) integer that is not greater than the original number. 
The floor of 1.65 is 1.0; the floor of -1.65 is -2.0

Ceiling: This conversion chooses the smallest (closest to negative infinity) integer that is not smaller than the original number.
The ceiling of 1.65 is 2.0; the ceiling of -1.65 is -1.0.

Round: This conversion chooses the integer closest to the original number. If two possible integers are equally close, 
the one that is even is chosen. This has the effect of a 50 percent chance of rounding down and a 50 percent chance of rounding up. 
Note that this is different from the rounding policy of the ROUND command.
