What is the difference between scope and block?

a scope is where you can refer to a variable. a block defines a block scope a variable defined inside a block will be defined only inside that block and you can't reference it after the end of block.

so in this code if you try something like:

x = 10;
if(x ==10) { // start new scope
int y = 20; // known only to this block
x = y * 2;
}

y = 5; // error y is out of scope, not it is not defined
because what you have here is a local scope
other kinds of scope in java are class scope (for example), a member of a class has a class scope so it is accessible anywhere inside a class.

the basic rules for scope are:

1.The scope of a parameter declaration is the body of the method in which the declaration appears.
2.The scope of a local-variable declaration is from the point at which the declaration appears to the end of that block.
3.The scope of a local-variable declaration that appears in the initialization section of a for statement’s header is the body of the for statement and the other expressions in the header.
4.A method or field’s scope is the entire body of the class. This enables non-static methods of a class to use the fields and other methods of the class.
